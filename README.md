## 2. Scope Map (Evolution)
We did not have a scope map. We did include a screenshot of the tasks showing the evolution of the todo tasks in each meeting minutes under "**Current Sprint Progress**". Project was managed using [GitHub Projects]((https://github.com/orgs/Vaultis/projects/1/views/4) to manage iterations.

Todo items used for hills chart tracking were documented on BaseCamp as follows:
